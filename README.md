# ConfigBuilder

This is a project to easily build engineering bills of materials with small configuration changes. 
It's a way to make the same bill of materials with a few component differences between them. No need to 
control+C or write a bunch of boilerplate.  

The idea is very early at this stage - all entry is just command line text. 

The idea is to migrate this to a Tkinter based app, or maybe even a web app, that spits out a nice, clean,
 formatted Excel document.
